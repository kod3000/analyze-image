# Analyze Image Frontend


Very basic frontend. Single page application that 
allows the upload of an image and displays the image
in a grid view with that of the response from the OpenAI API.


### Developer Notes

 - very barebones, Could use some routing and animations.
 - still needs middleware to send header to backend.


## Run Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
